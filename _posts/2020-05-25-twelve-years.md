The titles tells you half of the story, and the remaining is that 
a simple free man, not Morgan 😛, gets kidnapped and sold as a slave. 
Again from the name, it's his narration of 12 years in hell. 

Based of true story, and adapted from the memoirs of the protagonist 
himself, this movie touches with the portrayal and the hardships faced
by the slaves in pre civil war America. This movie features some of
the best actors and actresses. 

This movie is a must watch for people who love history movies and is 
rated R for violence and cruelty.
