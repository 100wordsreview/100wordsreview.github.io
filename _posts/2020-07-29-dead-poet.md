This coming-to-age movie explores the story of a group of boys who have always been academically focussed and ended up
in one of the best prep-school destined to go to Ivy leagues later. But in this school, they came in touch with a lively professor,
who is very unorthodox with his teaching method and tries to fun in learning.

Having an english class in the warm meadow so that you can appreciate nature while reading about it, this movie gives us a sneak of 
perfection and, in this moment of realization, urges everyone to live life at its fullest. Carpe-diem
