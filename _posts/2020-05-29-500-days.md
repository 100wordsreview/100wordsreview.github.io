This is / isn't a love story. Depends on your viewpoint.

You know you are in for an awesome adventure if something starts like this. And surely the movie won't disappoint.

The main idea of the film according to me is that "Many of us try to find the perfection in someone and get into the idealism so so much that forget the very individualism of the other person". I won't say anything more cause that may spoil the story
