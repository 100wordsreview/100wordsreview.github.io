This is one of the top movies that has quickly become a modern classic. It's a well made movie, storyline is pretty interesting.

The story follows an insomniac office worker who finds a new friend, devil-may-care soap-maker. Life is more interesting with him, and they start living together. They even start a fight club, where people come and fight and get their frustrations out. Slowly the plot thickens and the protagonist realises new troubles building up.

Another great thing about this movie is that it's great for re-watch. There are many clue left here and there, for a curious viewer.
