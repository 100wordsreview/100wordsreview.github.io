Excellent crime movie with the best performance of Kevin Spacey. This movie is on the list of all the crime thriller fans. Strong plot, well written character, and excellent background music, all that's needed to keep you till the last second of the reel and even years after that.

The base of the story is a heist was pulled by 5 men as a revenge on the NYPD, for arresting them as they were the usual suspects. The boat heist did not turn as expected and in the present, one of the survivor is narrating the story to the police.
