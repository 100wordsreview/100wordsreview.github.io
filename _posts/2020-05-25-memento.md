This movie is a piece of art. The way it is designed, the whole storyline,
you will take an hour to comprehend what just happened in the movie.
Needs complete attention. A guy trying to figure out his past as he suffers
from a medical condition. Story unfolds slowly. Keeps viewers on toes.

The editing and story telling technique is what takes this movie from
just another movie, to "once in a lifetime" experience. Classic case of 
confused protagonist. Two storyline runs in parallel,
one in b&w while other in colour, just helps you keep track and appreciate the style.
