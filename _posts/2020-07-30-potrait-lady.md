Happily bored. That's my state after watching this movie. Normally I have a stronger
liking for movies with great story-telling but this movie was more poem than prose.

It's a work of art and color and how every detail  is presented with patience.
As the character speak calmly, this makes the movie more realistic and gives the viewer
moments of intimacy and passion.

Though it's a movie in french, you can still see this language barrier disappear as this movie is more about
visual than verbal.

Highly recommended, but to be watched with a fresh mind and be okay to be bored for a while.

* ***Every time the camera focuses on a canvas, it is actually Hélène Delmaire , the original painter's hand that the viewer sees painting***
