This is one of the best movies of all time. Direction, story, acting, even small things like camera angle and lighting are the best. Every scene of this movie seems to be worked on and executed perfectly. It has been highly rated in all of the movie rating websites and is a must watch for all the moviebuffs.

The story is based on Sicilian Mafia in America and their head Vito Corleone who is a criminal mastermind, works under certain rules strictly to be followed. He is aging and the story covers the transfer of power of his clandestine empire.
