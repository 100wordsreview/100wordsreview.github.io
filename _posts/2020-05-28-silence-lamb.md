This movie is adapted from a book of the same name and it really does justice to the book. Everything about this movie is just great.  The best thing if I have to pick one is acting of Hannibal Lecter. It is really scary. The coldness you observe in every dialogue of Lecter wants you to revisit the film multiple times.

The story follows our protagonist who seeks help of Lecter, whose insights might help her in a case. Lecter agrees to offer clues in exchange of her personal information. There are multiple plots and story-line once the investigation continues.
