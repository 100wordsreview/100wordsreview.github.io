This is a crazy story. In the starting you will feel like a love story,
but there are multiple twist and turns further you watch. Personally, I
recommend this movie to watch with blank slate. Just watch with a fresh mind
and zero interruptions. Jim Carey's acting is always amazing and one of the
important reason for watching this movie.

The protagonist of this story is lovable. The story line is a bit non linear.
There are various surprises this movie will offer you so no spoilers. Do not see
the trailer or the IMDb description. Just see the movie.
