This website will contain primarily of movie reviews of the movies I love. Normally you won't find much
negative reviews here, but this list itself will be a selected one. So, if a movie is here, there is a 
good reason to watch it.

Apart from that, I will occasionally add reviews about novels and TV shows too. For the next 2-3 weeks, 
these reviews will be mostly the ones I have seen in the past and loved them. But many of the details
might be blur.

Needless to say, these are my personal opinion and it's okay if you don't agree to them. I really do not
want to start any debate. But you are welcome to express your opinions in the comments.

The name of website is something I will be trying to do as a part of uniqueness. The word count is not
exact and I haven't decided how I will count. This is also my beginning and I will learn as the time 
progresses.

> Thanks for reading ❤
