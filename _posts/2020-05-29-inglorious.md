A war film by one of the most iconic director of this century, this movie is of genre "Alternate History", something that is not much movies. 

The movie follows a group of soldiers who are on their own in German-occupied France, with only one mission. Kill as many German soldiers as possible. Apart from the hunt, they also come up with elaborate plans of assassination, and as expected from Tarantino, this movie has a lot of on-screen violence. The story line is great, and overall movie is fun to watch. Just be prepared to watch for some bloodshed and killings.
