This movie has a good story. Add to this, best editing, visual effects, cinematography and direction, delivers a masterpiece that you can watch multiple times.

A young architect is challenged to design a maze and our protagonist helps her through and encounters several of his past issues in the process. The assignment that their team has is called inception, something that is multi layer deep and very tough architecture to design. There are guns and actions and race and all the thrill accompanied with a great storyline to bind all of them together.

The real story is much more convoluted.
